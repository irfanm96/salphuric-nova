            <h1>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</h1>
            <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
            Salfade is located at:<br/>
            <address>
                Salfade<br/>311/1, Rajasinghapura, Muruthalawa Kandy <br/>20232 - Central , Sri Lanka<br/>94771121195
            </address>

            <p>It is Salfade's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating
                our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://salfade.com">https://salfade.com</a>
                (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://salfade.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to
                protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted
                this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how
                we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.
                This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our
                collection of information from other sources.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general
                rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our
                Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

            <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
            <p>Like most website operators, Salfade collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
                browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
                site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Salfade's purpose in collecting non-personally
                identifying information is to better understand how Salfade's visitors use its website. From time to
                time, Salfade may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a
                report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
            <p>Salfade also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
                addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://salfade.com blog posts. Salfade
                only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and
                discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

            <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <p>Certain visitors to Salfade's websites choose to interact with Salfade in ways that require Salfade to
                gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Salfade gathers
                depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
                https://salfade.com to provide a username and email address.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission
                over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
                acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

            <h2>Advertisements</h2>
            <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
                These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
                advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows
                ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most
                interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Salfade and does not cover the use of
                cookies by any advertisers.</p>


            <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
            <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third
                party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the
                Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>
            <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of
                any third party sites, products or services.</p>


            <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <p>Salfade discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those
                of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in
                order to process it on Salfade's behalf or to provide services available at Salfade's website, and (ii)
                that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
                organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Salfade's website, you consent to
                the transfer of such information to them. Salfade will not rent or sell potentially
                personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees,
                contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Salfade discloses potentially
                personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court
                order or other governmental request, or when Salfade believes in good faith that disclosure is
                reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Salfade, third parties or the public at
                large.</p>
            <p>If you are a registered user of https://salfade.com and have supplied your email address, Salfade may
                occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you
                up to date with what's going on with Salfade and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate
                this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request
                (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish
                it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Salfade
                takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or
                destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

            <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
            <p>Salfade may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Salfade may display this
                information publicly or provide it to others. However, Salfade does not disclose your
                personally-identifying information.</p>

            <h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
            <p>This site uses affiliate links and does earn a commission from certain links. This does not affect your
                purchases or the price you may pay.</p>

            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, Salfade uses "Cookies", similar technologies and services
                provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your preferences
                on your computer.</p>
            <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's
                browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Salfade uses cookies to help Salfade
                identify and track visitors, their usage of https://salfade.com, and their website access preferences.
                Salfade visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to
                refuse cookies before using Salfade's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Salfade's
                websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
            <p>By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge and
                agree to Salfade's use of cookies.</p>


            <h2>Business Transfers</h2>
            <p>If Salfade, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Salfade goes
                out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or
                acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of
                Salfade may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

            <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
            <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Salfade may change its Privacy Policy from time to time,
                and in Salfade's sole discretion. Salfade encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any
                changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy
                will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
